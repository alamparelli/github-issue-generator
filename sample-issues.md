# Implement user authentication

We need to add user authentication to our application. This should include:

- Sign up functionality
- Login functionality
- Password reset

# Add dark mode to the UI

Users have requested a dark mode for our application. We should implement this feature with the following considerations:

- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Persist user preference
- Ensure all components support both modes

# Optimize database queries

Our application is experiencing slow load times due to inefficient database queries. We need to optimize these queries to improve performance.

- Identify slow queries
- Use proper indexing
- Implement caching where appropriate
